# PiNodeScript

Before starting, take into account that this script is specifically designed for use with a 
raspberry pi zero W. As such, it assumes the package manager is aptitude and the desired NIC device
for use is named wlan1. However, the scripts will likely still work if you tweak the setup script to fit your
hardware and software infrastructure. 

For this script make sure to install it using the installer script provided that ensures all
programs and settings are such that the python script will work.
